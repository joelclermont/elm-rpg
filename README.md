# elm-rpg
A basic RPG implemented in Elm, with a reference JS implementation for comparison

Elm is one of my favorite things and I've tried to share that joy with my 15 year old son, who is very interested in programming. So you can just imagine my shock and horror to walk into his room and find him writing a game in JavaScript! How could he do this to me?!

I thought this could be a good opportunity to demonstrate why I like Elm, so I decided to reimplement his JS game in Elm. Then we could compare and contrast which was a better developer experience.

I also saw it as a good opportunity for me to learn. I've been using Elm for a little less than a year, but mainly for businessy web apps, nothing like games with sound and animation and collision detection. 

This repo contains both my Elm implementation and my son's JS implementation.
